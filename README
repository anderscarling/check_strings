# Check Strings (in XCode-style *.lproj directories)

Small hack to sanity check XCode-style strings files.

Just drop into a map with =*.lproj= dirs and the script will compare
=Localizable.strings= in all directories to the one in =en.lproj=.

## Implemented checks
* Missing string compared to base language
* Extra string compared to base language
* String with identical name and value compated to base
